## Front End
The front end will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) due to it's maturity and avilability of resources.

## Back End
The back end of the application will use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). These will communicate with an associated [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database for data storage.

## API
A [REST](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design) API will be developed to allow the front end to interact with the backend.

## Deployment
The application will be deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) through a GitHub Actions pipeline.
